# Amazelenium
For the Symbility Intersect Software Engineer in Test Code Challenge Problem. You can use a Selenium script to do exactly around 5 things with Amazon. Amazing right?!?

## Prerequisites
Latest version of Chrome, Python, and Selenium installed

## Instructions
- Ensure you have both the "test" and "drivers" folders on your computer
- Run test/mainTest.py
- Type in '1','2','3','4', or '5' for the desired use case to be automated
- Enjoy watching Amazon being opened on Chrome

## Assumptions
It seems like the code challenge only wanted me to automate those use cases, and not create test cases for them.
